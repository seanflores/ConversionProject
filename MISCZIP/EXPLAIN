                      EXPLANATION OF PROGRAM LISTING

MASTER FREQUENCY LIST 
  This is the master of frequencies from which each program (P1 to P9)may 
  choose.  It is created for each file and may contain any frequency from
  10 to 9999.  If the serial number of the instrument contains an "A"
  prefix, it is capable of 18 programs (P1 to P18) and frequencies from
  1 to 9999.  The following description applies to the "A" version also
  but with the preceding enhancements.

DESCRIPTION
  Each of the 9 programs from P1 to P9 may be customized with the parameters
  shown at the top of each programming box.  The format is:
  
          STEP/ DWELL /CONTINUOUS
          SCAN         INTERRUPTED

  STEP - The program steps through each frequency shown.
  SCAN - The program starts with the first frequency and then advances to
         a frequency one higher and continues until it reaches the last
         frequency and then it starts over.  Only the first and last frequency
         need be on the master frequency list.  At the higher frequencies, it
         will skip some of the frequencies in order to go from the first to
         the last in a reasonable amount of time.

  DWELL - This value is the time in seconds that is spent on each frequency
         before advancing to the next frequency.

  CONTINUOUS (CONT) - This indicates that the output frequency is continuous.
  INTERRUPTED (# SECONDS) - This is the time in seconds that output frequency
         is ON and the equal length of time that the output frequency is OFF.
         This time should be less than the Dwell time so that each frequency
         will turn on and off a number of times while that frequency is
         selected.

 
EXAMPLES
  1.  STEP/ 1.2/0.30
        20  660  880  2720
        26  666  885  5000
        60  etc.
      The program will produce 20 Hz for 1.2 seconds and the frequency will
      be output for .3 seconds and then will be off (no output) for .3 seconds
      and then will be output for .3 seconds etc.  At the end of the 1.2 
      seconds dwell time, it will step to 26 Hz for 1.2 seconds with .3 
      seconds ON and .3 seconds OFF.  This is continued for each frequency 
      listed and then the program will repeat.

  2.  SCAN/ 3/CONT
         20
        125
      The program will start with 20 Hz and this frequency will be output 
      continuously (no interruption) for 3 seconds and then the output will
      change to 21 Hz and it will be output for 3 seconds and then 22 Hz etc.
      After 125 Hz has been output for 3 seconds, the program will repeat.
