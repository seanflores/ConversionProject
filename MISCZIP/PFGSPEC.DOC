                        MODEL  PFG-100


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Model PFG-100 Programmable Frequency Generator is a microcomputer-based,
line-powered, square-wave generator with a range of 10 Hz to 9,999 Hz that 
provides the user with a front panel selection of 1 to 9 programmed
sequences of frequencies.  Each frequency in the chosen sequence is 
maintained on the output for a pre-selected time interval from 0.2 seconds
to 20 minutes.  In addition, all frequencies in a given sequence are 
pre-set either to be continuous or to be interrupted with equal on and off
intervals from 0.1 to 4.0 seconds.  Two modes of sequencing are available
for each of the 9 programmed sequences.

    STEP  MODE:  Each frequency in the sequence is pre-selected and the
                 program steps through each frequency in order and then
                 repeats.

    SCAN  MODE:  Only the lowest and highest frequencies of the desired
                 sequence are pre-selected and the program steps through
                 all of the in-between frequencies using small incremental
                 changes in frequency.  When the program reaches the
                 highest frequency, the scan begins again from the
                 lowest frequency. For frequencies under 1024 Hz, the
                 frequency increments are 1 Hz.  Above 1024 Hz, the
                 frequency increments increase from 0.1% at 1024 Hz to
                 1% at 9999 Hz.

A four-digit LED readout provides a display of the current square-wave
output frequency in Hertz (cycles per second).  The internal crystal-
controlled microcomputer generates the frequencies automatically so no 
manual frequency adjustment is required.  A manual OUTPUT level control
provides adjustment of the output amplitude from 0 V to 20 V peak-to-peak
(+-10 V peak).

Three pushbutton switches marked START, HOLD and PRGM (Program) provide
operational control by starting the sequence, holding the current frequency
and selecting the desired program.  After a program from 1 to 9 is
selected, and the sequence is initiated with the START switch, no further
operation of the controls is required, except possibly to adjust the output
level.  The sequence repeats indefinitely, but may be interrupted at any 
time by selecting another program.

The output signal leads may be accidentally shorted together without any
damage to the instrument and the instrument will continue to function
normally when the short is removed.  In addition, user safety is enhanced
by conservative circuit design and special attention to component ratings
and printed circuit board lead spacings that essentially eliminate any 
danger of shock from the power line.

The PFG-100 may be re-programmed any number of times from a computer 
over a cable that plugs into the rear of the instrument.  This means
that the instrument will not become obsolete when new and different
frequencies become desirable.








CONTROLS
--------

The user front panel controls consist of an output level control marked
OUTPUT at the upper right, a program selector pushbutton marked PRGM, a
HOLD pushbutton and a START pushbutton.  The  POWER ON-OFF switch is 
located at the left rear of the instrument.

POWER:   This switch turns power ON or OFF to the instrument.

OUTPUT:  This control adjusts the square-wave output level over a range
         of 0 V to 20 V peak-to-peak.

START:   When momentarily pushed, this pushbutton starts the pre-
         determined sequence of output frequencies.  If pushed after the
         sequence has started, the program advances to the next frequency
         in the sequence immediately without waiting for the present 
         frequency dwell time to expire.  Its operation is the same in 
         either the Step mode or the Scan mode.

HOLD:    When momentarily pushed while a frequency is being displayed, 
         this pushbutton causes that frequency to be held indefinitely.
         This condition is indicated by the lighting of all decimal
         points on the display.

         The frequency is then held until either
           (1) the START pushbutton is pressed to take the instrument 
               out of the HOLD condition and advance it to the next 
               frequency in the sequence, or
           (2) the PRGM pushbutton is pressed to advance the instrument
               to the next program.

PRGM:    When momentarily pushed, this pushbutton causes the instrument
         to advance to the next available program number, P1 to P9 as
         indicated on the display.


OPERATING PROCEDURE
-------------------

1.  Check to ensure that the power line voltage correctly corresponds to 
    the voltage shown on the rear panel label.  Then plug the instrument 
    into the power line and turn on the POWER switch.  The display lights 
    with "P 1".  This is the first programmed sequence of frequencies.  If 
    this is the desired program, go to step 2 below.  If not, press PRGM to 
    select program 2 and display "P 2".  Repeat until the desired program 
    number P1 to P9 is displayed.  The PRGM pushbutton cycles the selection 
    back to P1 following P9.

2.  Push the START pushbutton momentarily and then release it.  The first
    frequency in the sequence of the selected program is applied to the 
    output and its frequency value replaces the program number P1 to P9 
    on the display.  That frequency remains on the output for the pre-set 
    dwell time and then the next frequency appears on the display and is 
    applied to the output.  When the sequence reaches the end, it 
    automatically repeats and this cycling continues indefinitely.










3.  Other actions that may be taken at any time are:

      (1)  Momentarily push HOLD at any time to hold indefinitely the 
           frequency being displayed, or

      (2)  Momentarily push PRGM to advance to the next program.

    In either case, push START as in Step 2 to begin sequencing again.

4.  When no more operation is desired, turn the POWER switch off.

Note: If it is desired to step the program rapidly through the sequence of
      frequencies to reach a particular frequency of interest, this can be
      achieved by repeatedly pushing and releasing the START pushbutton.
      Since each frequency in the sequence is displayed, this action can
      be terminated when the desired frequency is indicated.


PROGRAMMING
-----------

The preceding information applies to an instrument that has been pre-
programmed with up to 9 different sequences of frequencies.  The 
instrument may be programmed by the factory, the distributor or the user.
Once programmed, the data is retained in non-volatile memory.  Therefore 
the power can be turned off and the data will not be lost.  This is a
special memory requiring no batteries.

Programming of the PFG-100 is accomplished via the rear sub-miniature 
phone jack.  A programming cable connects from the jack to a serial 
(RS-232) port of an IBM PC/XT/AT computer or equivalent.  Factory software
is available for convenient programming of the instrument.

Programming is performed in two parts.

Part 1.

    A master list is created of all of the frequencies that are required
    for each of the 9 program selections.  This list must also include the
    lowest and highest frequencies desired in each Scan mode program.
    This master frequency list has capacity for a total of 64 different
    frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 9,999 Hz.  Any integer values in
    this range may be included.

Part 2.

    For each program P1 to P9, a sub-list of frequencies plus three
    parameters are selected.  The sub-list of frequencies is selected
    from the master frequency list created in Part 1.  They may be
    different frequencies for each program or some may be common or all
    may be common.  However, the sum total of the number of frequencies
    in the sub-lists of P1 through P9 cannot exceed 118, even though
    some may be common.













    The three parameters to be chosen are (1) the mode, (2) the dwell
    time, and (3) the interrupt time.

          Mode    = two choices, Step or Scan.  
                    In the Step mode, the program sequences through the 
                      sub-list of frequencies which may contain any number 
                      from 1 to 64.  
                    In the Scan mode, the sub-list consists of two, and
                      only two frequencies, the lowest and highest to 
                      scan between.  The PFG-100 sequences between these
                      limits using small frequency increments.

      Dwell Time  = the length of time that a particular frequency is 
                    being output before the PFG-100 advances to the next
                    frequency.

   Interrupt Time = the time that the particular frequency being output
                    is on and the equal time that it is off.  This 
                    gating of the frequency repeats continually during
                    the Dwell Time.  Continuous operation without any
                    interruption may also be selected.

   The three parameters to be selected must be chosen from a factory
   list of values and the parameter selection applies to all of the
   frequencies in a given program's sub-list.  However, a different 
   set of parameters may be selected for each of the nine programs from
   P1 to P9. 

   The factory list of values for the three parameters are:

          Mode      Dwell Time       Interrupt Time
          ----      ----------       --------------
          Step       0.2 sec               0.10 sec
          Scan       0.6                   0.15
                     1.2                   0.3 
                       3                   0.5 
                      10                   1.0
                      20                   2.0
                      30                   4.0
                      45                Continuous
                      60
                      90
                     120
                     180
                     300
                     600
                    1200
                 Infinite

The instrument is capable of storing a total of 118 sub-list frequencies.
This can be allotted in any manner between the 9 program selections.  The
following 5 examples illustrate the principle by listing an acceptable
number of sub-list frequencies in each of the 9 programs.













Example P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9
------- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  #1    14 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13
  #2    40  2 40  2 34  0  0  0  0   Do not need to use all P1 through P9
  #3    59 59  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Same freq in P1 & P2 but diff parameters
  #4    20 10 10 10  2  2  2  2  2   Not all 118 need be used.      
  #5    20 10  0 10  0  0  0  0  0   P4 is not accessible to the user because
                                       P3 is blank.  Programs terminate on
                                       first blank sub-list.
       
The software allows the user to choose the frequencies, the Mode, the 
Dwell Time and the Interrupt Time for each of 9 programs to be stored in 
the PFG100.  After being selected, this total data for the 9 programs is
stored in a single file on the floppy disk for future use.  The user 
chooses a name for the saved file that can be remembered at a later time.  
File names can be from 1 to 8 letters or numbers but must start with a 
letter (e.g. E1HELP9 ).  The software is used to (1) create a new file as 
described above and store it on the floppy disk, (2) recall an old file, 
modify it and store it under the same name (or store it under a new name, 
leaving the old name and file intact for future use) and (3) selecting a 
file from those stored on the floppy disk and sending the data to the 
PFG-100 where it is stored for use.  The floppy disk has space for about 
a 100 files.
