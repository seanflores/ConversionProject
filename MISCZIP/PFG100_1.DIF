PFG100.DIF


                   NEW PROGRAMMABLE FREQUENCY GENERATOR
                              PFG100


I.  Differences to CRF1000

    A. Added a programmable feature.
       From 1 to 5 selectable programs available to the user by pushing the
       PROGRAM (black) pushbutton.  Each is identified by the display of
       P 1  to  P 5.  Each program is run much like the CRF1000 using the
       START (green) and HOLD (red) pushbuttons.  The parameters for each
       program may be defined as follows:

          1.  Dwell Time.  
                The time each frequency stays on in seconds.  This is always
                3 seconds for the CRF1000 but may be set to different values
                for this new instrument.

          2.  Interrupt Time.  
                Each frequency, while is is on, is interrupted at a regular
                rate.  The on time and equal off time in seconds can be set.
                It is always 0.15 seconds for the CRF1000 but may be set to
                different values for this new instrument.

          3.  Frequencies.  
                Each program contains a selected sequence of any number of
                frequencies from 1 to 30 from a predetermined list of 30 
                frequencies (the prototype is limited to 17 by the software).

       The Dwell Time and Interrupt Time are the same for all frequencies
       in a given program but may be set differently for other programs.

    B.  Added a programming jack to the rear panel.  You can program the
        instrument from your computer using the cable and software I furnish
        you or I can program it for you to your specifications prior to
        shipping.  It can be re-programmed any number of times.

    C.  Changed to a more predominant push-button switch, color-coded for
        easier user identification and added a PROGRAM select pushbutton.

    D.  Added a bail that serves the double purpose of handle and tilt-
        stand.

    E.  Reduced the size of the display bezel to maintain maximum rigidity
        of the plastic panel.

    F.  Moved the power switch to the rear for reduced wiring complications
        and greater user safety.

    G.  Eliminated the 115V/230V power switch to reduce manufacturing cost
        and user operating errors.  Instruments may be converted from one
        voltage to the other but it requires removing the circuit board
        from the case.  It is best that 230V units be ordered as needed.
        No extra charge.














II.  Production Instrument notes

    A.  The production unit will have a dark gray front and rear plastic
        panel instead of the black ones on the prototype.  This color 
        combination matches current hi-tech equipment including computers
        and computer keyboards.

    B.  It will have a silk-screened panel similar to the CRF1000.

    C.  It will have an output control marked 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 9.

    D.  It will be capable of a total, for all 5 programs, of 50 frequency
        selections instead of the 35 for the prototype.
