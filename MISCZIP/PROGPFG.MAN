1.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE PFG-100 INSTRUMENT

The Model PFG-100 Programmable Frequency Generator is a microcomputer-based,
line-powered, square-wave generator with a range of 10 Hz to 9,999 Hz that 
provides the user with a front panel selection of 1 to 9 Programmed
sequences of frequencies.  Each frequency in the chosen sequence is 
maintained on the output for a pre-selected time interval from 0.2 seconds
to 20 minutes.  In addition, all frequencies in a given sequence are 
pre-set either to be continuous or to be interrupted with equal on and off
intervals from 0.1 to 4.0 seconds.  Two modes of sequencing are available
for each of the 9 Programmed sequences.

    STEP  MODE:  Each frequency in the sequence is pre-selected and the
                 Program steps through each frequency in order and then
                 repeats.

    SCAN  MODE:  Only the lowest and highest frequencies of the desired
                 sequence are pre-selected and the Program steps through
                 all of the in-between frequencies using small incremental
                 changes in frequency.  When the Program reaches the
                 highest frequency, the scan begins again from the
                 lowest frequency. For frequencies under 1024 Hz, the
                 frequency increments are 1 Hz.  Above 1024 Hz, the
                 frequency increments increase from 0.1% at 1024 Hz to
                 1% at 9999 Hz.

A four-digit LED readout provides a display of the current square-wave
output frequency in Hertz (cycles per second).  The internal crystal-
controlled microcomputer generates the frequencies automatically so no 
manual frequency adjustment is required.  A manual OUTPUT level control
provides adjustment of the output amplitude from 0 V to 20 V peak-to-peak
(+-10 V peak).

Three pushbutton switches marked START, HOLD and PRGM (Program) provide
operational control by starting the sequence, holding the current frequency
and selecting the desired Program.  After a Program number from 1 to 9 is
selected, and the sequence is initiated with the START button, no further 
operation of the controls is required, except possibly to adjust the output
level.  The sequence repeats indefinitely, but may be interrupted at any 
time by selecting another Program.

The output signal leads may be accidentally shorted together without any
damage to the instrument and the instrument will continue to function
normally when the short is removed.  In addition, user safety is enhanced
by conservative circuit design and special attention to component ratings
and printed circuit board lead spacings that greatly minimize any danger of
shock from the power line.

The PFG-100 may be re-programmed any number of times from a computer 
over a cable that plugs into the rear of the instrument.  This means
that the instrument will not become obsolete when new and different
frequencies become desirable.

2.0  GENERAL PROGRAMMING DESCRIPTION

The PFG-100 is programmed from an IBM-compatible computer, using the
SP1 software, with up to 9 different sequences of frequencies.  The 
instrument may be programmed by the factory, the distributor or the user.
Once programmed, the data is retained in non-volatile memory.  Therefore, 
the power can be turned off and the data will not be lost.  This is a
special memory requiring no batteries.

Programming of the PFG-100 is accomplished via the rear sub-miniature 
phone jack.  A programming cable connects from the jack to a serial 
(RS-232) port of an IBM PC/XT/AT computer or equivalent.  The software
prompts the programmer via menus to enter the desired data for up to
9 Programs.  When complete, the data is saved in a file that is stored
on the computer disk.  Upon command, the software reads the data file
and automatically converts the data to a string of characters which are 
sent to the PFG-100 over the serial data cable, where they are stored in 
memory.  The programming phase is then complete and the PFG-100 is ready 
to use.  It may be re-programmed any number of times.

Programming is performed in two parts.

Part 1.

    A Master list is created of all of the frequencies that are required
    for each of the 9 Program selections.  This list must also include the
    lowest and highest frequencies desired in each Scan mode Program.
    This Master Frequency list has capacity for a total of 64 different
    frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 9,999 Hz.  Any integer values in
    this range may be included.

Part 2.

    For each Program P1 to P9, a sub-list of frequencies plus three
    parameters are selected.  The sub-list of frequencies is selected
    from the Master Frequency list created in Part 1.  They may be
    different frequencies for each Program or some may be common or all
    may be common.  However, the sum total of the number of frequencies
    in the sub-lists of P1 through P9 cannot exceed 118, even though
    some may be common.

    The three parameters to be chosen are (1) the mode, (2) the dwell
    time, and (3) the interrupt time.

          Mode    = two choices, Step or Scan.  

                    In the Step mode, the Program sequences through the 
                      selected sub-list of frequencies which may contain 
                      any number of the Master list frequencies from 
                      1 to all.  It then returns to the low frequency
                      and repeats the sequence.  This continues as
                      long as that Program is selected.
                    
                    In the Scan mode, the sub-list consists of two, and
                      only two frequencies, the lowest and highest to 
                      scan between.  The PFG-100 automatically sequences 
                      from the low limit to the high limit using small 
                      frequency increments.  It then returns to the low
                      limit and repeats the scan.  This continues as
                      long as that Program is selected. 
                                  (2)



      Dwell Time  = the length of time that a particular frequency is 
                    being output before the PFG-100 advances to the next
                    frequency.

   Interrupt Time = the time that the particular frequency being output
                    is on and the equal time that it is off.  This 
                    gating of the frequency repeats continually during
                    the Dwell Time.  Continuous operation without any
                    interruption may also be selected.

   The three parameters to be selected must be chosen from a factory
   list of values and the parameter selection applies to all of the
   frequencies in a given Program's sub-list.  However, a different 
   set of parameters may be selected for each of the nine Programs from
   P1 to P9. 

   The factory list of values for the three parameters are:

          Mode      Dwell Time       Interrupt Time
          ----      ----------       --------------
          Step       0.2 sec               0.10 sec
          Scan       0.6                   0.15
                     1.2                   0.3 
                       3                   0.5 
                      10                   1.0
                      20                   2.0
                      30                   4.0
                      45                Continuous
                      60
                      90
                     120
                     180
                     300
                     600
                    1200
                 Infinite

The instrument is capable of storing a total of 118 sub-list frequencies.
This can be allotted in any manner between the 9 Program selections.  The
following 5 examples illustrate the principle by listing an acceptable
number of sub-list frequencies in each of the 9 Programs.

Example P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9	   Comments
------- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   ---------------------------------------
  #1    14 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13   Exactly 118 sub-list frequencies
  #2    40  2 40  2 34  0  0  0  0   Do not need to use all P1 through P9
  #3    59 59  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Same freq in P1 & P2 but diff parameters
  #4    20 10 10 10  2  2  2  2  2   Not all 118 need be used.      
  #5    20 10  0 10  0  0  0  0  0   P4 is not accessible to the user because
                                       P3 is blank.  Programs terminate on
                                       first blank sub-list.
       
The software allows the user to choose the frequencies, the Mode, the 
Dwell Time and the Interrupt Time for each of 9 Programs to be stored in 
the PFG-100.  After being selected, this total data for the 9 Programs is
stored in a single file on the floppy disk for future use.  The user 
chooses a name for the saved file that can be remembered at a later time.  
File names can be from 1 to 8 letters or numbers but must start with a 
letter (e.g. E1HELP9 ).  
                                  (3)




The software is used to: 
  (1) create a new file as described above and store it on the floppy disk, 
  (2) recall an old file, modify it and store it under the same name (or 
        store it under a new name, leaving the old name and file intact 
        for future use) and 
  (3) selecting a file from those stored on the floppy disk and sending 
        the data to the PFG-100 where it is stored for use.  The floppy 
        disk has space for about a 100 files. 


3.0 CONNECTING THE HARDWARE

A cable is available as an option that provides the connection for transfer 
of the data from the computer to the PFG-100.  One end of the cable contains 
a miniature phone plug that plugs into the rear of the PFG-100.  The other 
end of the cable contains either a 25-pin or a 9-pin Subminiature D 
connector that plugs into one of the serial ports on the rear of the 
computer.  If the serial port(s) have a different connector than is on the 
cable, consider purchasing an adapter plug to mate the two together.  Be 
sure to check the number of pins and the gender required of both of the 
connectors on the adapter plug before purchasing.  Radio Shack is a good 
source for adapter plugs.

If the serial port(s) are already in use, consider unplugging one to allow
sending data to the PFG100 and then replacing it when done.


4.0 INITIATING THE SOFTWARE

Turn on the computer in a normal manner.  Put the floppy disk in the floppy
drive of the computer and select the drive by typing the drive letter 
followed by a colon.  Typically, the floppy drive is the "A" drive and if
so type "A:".  The computer should respond with the prompt 
   A:>
Type PFG100
   A:>PFG100
The software responds with the question
   "Is the programming cable connected to COM(1) or COM(2) ? >"
If you know which Serial I/O port the cable is connected to, type the 
appropriate "1" or "2".  If you do not know the COM #, type "1" and select 
(S) SEND FILE from the MAIN MENU and when the question "NAME OF FILE TO 
SEND (CR TO CANCEL) ? >" appears on the screen, type "TEST1" to send a 
test file to the PFG-100.  Look at the PFG-100 display while pushing 
"Enter" at the end of typing the file name.  If the display goes blank for 
an instant and then comes up with "P 1", COM 1 is correct.  If the display 
does not go blank for an instant, then terminate the software program (see
below) and start it again, this time responding with "2".  If the display
goes blank and then "P 1" this time, then COM 2 is correct.  If not, 
check the cable connections and repeat.  Once you have determined the 
correct COM number, either 1 or 2, remember this number for future use and 
remember also where the cable is connected to the computer.






                                  (4)








TERMINATING THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM 
There are two methods to terminate the software program at any time.
  (1) Return to the MAIN MENU and select (Q) QUIT.  This will terminate
      the program in an orderly manner.
  (2) While holding down the "Ctrl" key, press the "Break" key.  This
      will cause an immediate termination of any program instruction in
      process and the messages "*Break*" and "Hit any key to return to 
      system" will appear.  Be careful when terminating the program with 
      this method because any data being stored on disk or sent to the 
      PFG-100 will be corrupted by the sudden termination.

KEY PRESS NOTES
These are some special notes relating to the use of the keyboard in
connection with the programming software.

  (1) Several of the prompts that ask for file names contain the following:
           (CR TO CANCEL)
      "CR" stands for Carriage Return and is a carry-over from typewriters.
      The corresponding key on the computer keyboard is "Enter".  The
      above statement means to hit "Enter" without typing any characters
      to abort the present state of the program and return to the menu.  
  (2) Menu responses require only 1 character so the software responds 
      immediately when a key is pressed.  On the other hand, file names 
      require from 1 to 8 characters, so the "Enter" key must be pressed
      after typing in the name, to inform the software that the name is
      complete. 
  (3) The "Ctrl-Break" sequence described above in (2) of TERMINATING
      THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM can be used if the computer locks up for any
      reason, preventing the normal (Q) QUIT from being used in the MAIN
      MENU. 


5.0 MAIN MENU

When the COM number has been entered, the MAIN MENU is displayed.  It
requests a selection from the following:
 
                        M A I N   M E N U
                        -----------------

                        (C) CREATE FILE
                        (E) EDIT FILE
                        (S) SEND FILE
                        (P) PRINT FILE
			(Q) QUIT    


                        SELECTION ? > _


The proper response is the appropriate letter C, E, S, P or Q.  A 
description of each selection follows.




                                  (5)









(C) CREATE FILE   
     This selection allows the user to start from scratch and build a
     file containing data for up to 9 Programs.  This is done in two
     parts as mentioned above in 2.0.  
     
     Part 1 is to create a Master Frequency list of all frequencies that 
       will be used in the Programs 1-9.
     Part 2 is to create up to 9 Programs by selecting a sub-list of
       frequencies from the Master list and selecting the 3 desired
       parameters.

     When "C" is selected, the CREATE FILE MENU appears on the screen.
     Section 6.0 CREATE FILE MENU explains the choices available which
     are basically Part 1  CREATE MASTER FREQUENCY LIST
               and Part 2  CREATE PROGRAM P1
                                 to
                           CREATE PROGRAM P9
      
     
(E) EDIT FILE
     
     This selection causes a new screen to appear with the question "NAME
     OF FILE TO EDIT (CR TO CANCEL) ? >".  If the file name entered has 
     been saved previously on the floppy disk, a copy of it is brought into 
     computer memory and the EDIT FILE MENU is displayed.  The data 
     represents the prior selections just as they were saved under the file 
     name.  There are now 3 courses of action.

     (1)  Using the EDIT FILE MENU, you may merely view the file data to
          see what selections that file name represents.  

          When done viewing, return to the MAIN MENU.  That file still 
          exists and no new files are created.

     (2)  Using the EDIT FILE MENU, you may make changes to the file data.

          When the formatted data appears in response to a Program number,
          use the arrow direction keys for placement of the cursor
          and then the "Enter" key to toggle selections off and on (see
          7.0 EDIT FILE MENU).  When all of the formatted Program screens
          have been changed the way you desire it, you can type "S" SAVE
          FILE to save the data.  When it asks "NAME OF FILE TO SAVE DATA 
          UNDER (CR TO CANCEL) ? >" you can respond with the old file name 
          to replace the old file data with the changed file data.  It will 
          caution you that a file with that name already exits and that the 
          file data will be replaced with new data.  When it asks
          "PROCEED (Y/N) ? >" you will respond "Y".

     (3)  Using the EDIT FILE MENU, you may create a new file by making 
          changes to a copy of an old file and saving under a new name.
 
          This is the same as (2) except after typing "S" SAVE FILE, you 
          can respond to "NAME OF FILE TO SAVE DATA UNDER ? > " with a new
          file name which creates a new file and keeps the original data
          under the old name.
    

                                  (6) 








(S) SEND FILE 

     This selection causes a new screen to appear with the question 
     "NAME OF FILE TO SEND (CR TO CANCEL) ? > ".  Type in the name of the 
     previously saved file that you want to send to the PFG-100.  Only 
     files that have been saved can be sent to the PFG-100.  If the name
     of a file is typed that has not been saved on disk, the comment
     "FILE NOT FOUND" appears and then the above question is repeated.  
     Another name may be tried or the "Enter" (CR) key hit without a name 
     to cancel the request and return to the MAIN MENU.

     If the file is found, its data is sent over the cable to the PFG-100.
     Each file contains data for up to 9 Programs to be stored in the
     PFG-100.  Data files are identified by name so they can be recalled 
     at a future time and the same data loaded into the PFG100.  For 
     example, "SAM1" and "SAM2" could be the names of two files, each with 
     9 Programs.  "SAM1" could be sent to the PFG-100 and the instrument 
     used for a period of time, and then "SAM2" could be sent to the 
     PFG-100 and those 9 Programs used for a period of time.  Later, "SAM1" 
     could be loaded again and this process repeated over and over.


(P) PRINT FILE
     This selection causes a new screen to appear with the question,
"NAME OF FILE TO BE PRINTED (CR TO CANCEL) ? > ".  If there is a printer
connected to the computer, type in the name of the file to be printed.  
The file contents will be printed and can be put into a notebook for 
future reference.  Only files that have been saved to disk can be printed.  
The Master Frequency list appears on the left, extending down from the top 
2/3 of the sheet.  The 3 Program parameters, Mode, Dwell time and Interrupt 
time appear in that order but unlabeled just below the Program #x 
underline.  The sub-lists of frequencies are arranged in 3 groups of 3 
Programs per group.  The data extends completely over an 8 1/2 X 11 
sheet so the top margin must be carefully adjusted. 

(Q) QUIT  

     This selection causes the software to exit back to the computer's
     operating system.

6.0 CREATE FILE MENU
     
     When "C" is selected from the MAIN MENU, this CREATE FILE MENU is
     displayed from which formatted screens are selected to enter the
     main frequency list or Programs 1-9.  When all of the data has been 
     entered for the complete file, it may be saved by hitting (S) SAVE
     FILE while in the CREATE FILE MENU.

HIT 'Z' TO ZERO DATA, 'R' TO RETURN TO MENU


(M) CREATE MASTER FREQUENCY LIST

     This selection causes a formatted screen to appear that initially
     contains "????" to indicate each frequency entry location.  There are 
     a total of 64 frequency locations divided into 4 columns of 16 rows 
     each.  Enter all of the frequencies in this Master list that will be 
     selected in each of the 9 Program's sub-list of frequencies.  If you 
     don't include a desired frequency in the Master list at this stage, 
     you will not be able to select it later when creating the Programs 
     1-9.  A particular frequency need be entered only once on the Master 
     list, even though it is used in all of the 9 Program's sub-lists. 

     The "????" at the top of the first column will be flashing to indicate
     that this is the active location for a frequency entry.  Type in the 
     first frequency using a value from 10 to 9999 and then hit "Enter".
     The value will appear in reverse video (dark numbers on a white back-
     ground) to indicate that this value has been selected.  The second
     location in the first column will be flashing for entry of the second
     value. Enter the second value in the same way. Proceed until all of
     the desired frequencies have been entered.  The software does not 
     allow a frequency value less than 10 or greater than 9999 to be 
     entered.

     Any location in the 4 columns may be selected for entry by using
     the 4 arrow keys on the right of the keyboard.  The current location
     is always identified by the flashing characters.  Pushing the right
     arrow key when the location is in the right-hand column causes the
     location to wrap-around to the left-hand column.  Likewise, the left 
     arrow key causes wrap-around in the other direction.  The up and
     down arrow keys also cause wrap-around in the vertical directions.







                                  (8)






     Any entry may be de-selected by locating it with the arrow keys
     and then pushing "Enter".  That location then turns from reverse
     video to normal video.  It will not be included in the final frequency
     list even though the value still remains.  Only those values in 
     reverse video are accepted as selected values.  That value may be 
     selected again by locating it with the arrow keys and pushing "Enter".  
     That location then reverts back to reverse video.  Pushing "Enter" at 
     a given location always toggles that location between selected and not
     selected or between not selected and selected as evidenced by the
     toggling of the normal and reverse video.

     Once all of the frequencies have been entered, type "R" to return
     to the CREATE FILE MENU.  The software will read all of the selected
     frequencies from the screen, sort them in numerical order, and put
     them in temporary memory.  If "M" is typed again, the formatted
     Master Frequency list screen appears again and all of the
     previously created frequencies are printed but in numerical
     order.  A frequency can now be deleted from the list by selecting 
     it and hitting "Enter" or a frequency can be added by locating
     any "????" and typing in the value and hitting "Enter".  A frequency
     can be changed by locating it and typing over its value with a
     new value and hitting "Enter".

(1) CREATE PROGRAM P1  (typical of all 9)

     This selection causes the Program formatted screen to appear with 
     the Master Frequency list, and 3 columns containing the factory-
     determined list of parameter values for the Mode, the Dwell Time and
     the Interrupt Time.  Only one selection is made for the Mode, the 
     Dwell Time and the Interrupt Time but any number of Frequencies may 
     be selected from the Master Frequency list from 1 to all.

     SELECTING THE SUB-LIST FREQUENCIES
     ------------------------------------
     The Master Frequency list is reproduced in the Program formatted
     screen in the same four columns as the Master Frequency list 
     formatted screen except when a particular Program number screen is 
     selected for the first time, none of the frequencies are selected.
     Using the arrow keys, locate each frequency in the list that is 
     desired for the Program number being created and hit the "Enter" key
     to select it.  The frequency will go to reverse video to indicate
     that it was selected.  To de-select any frequency that was mistakenly
     selected, locate it and hit the "Enter" key again which toggles it
     back from reverse video to normal video.  

     Return to a particular Program number formatted screen at any time
     and the reproduced Master Frequency list will contain the previously
     selected sub-list frequencies as indicated by the reverse video of
     those values.  New frequencies may be selected or selected frequencies
     may be de-selected from the sub-list by toggling their
     respective locations with the "Enter" key.  However, a frequency
     value in this reproduced Master Frequency list cannot be changed
     to a new value without returning to the Master Frequency list 
     formatted screen with the "M" selection of the CREATE FILE MENU.  



                                  (9)








  NOTE OF CAUTION - If the Master Frequency list is altered by adding or 
     deleting frequencies after some or all of the sub-list frequencies 
     have been selected in the Program formatted screens, it will be 
     necessary to revise the sub-list selections because the position of 
     the frequencies in the Master list will have shifted from their 
     original positions.  For this reason, it is important that the 
     original Master list of frequencies be carefully chosen so that no 
     changes will be required after the sub-lists are selected. If this 
     does happen, it may be easier to zero the sub-list of frequency 
     selections by using the "Z" command to zero or blank the previous 
     selections and then re-select from scratch.

     SELECTING THE PARAMETERS
     ------------------------
     When the frequency sub-list is selected, use the arrow keys to locate
     the 3 parameter values.  These parameter values remain the same for
     all of the frequencies in the Program's sub-list.  However, a 
     different set of parameters may be chosen for each of the 9 Programs.  
     Two Programs could have an identical sub-list of frequencies and a
     different set of parameters.

     There are only 2 choices for Mode: Step and Scan.  Locate the desired 
     Mode and hit "Enter".  If Scan is selected there must be exactly 2 
     frequencies selected in the sub-list, a low frequency and a high 
     frequency.  An error message will warn if other than 2 frequencies 
     are selected, so use the arrow keys to return to the sub-list and add 
     or remove selected frequencies until there is exactly 2.

     There are 15 values of the Dwell Time from .2 seconds to 20 minutes
     to Infinity from which one, and only one, must be selected.  The Dwell 
     Time is the length of time each frequency is on the output (and 
     display) before advancing to the next frequency.  

     There are 7 values of the Interrupt Time from .1 seconds to 4 seconds
     to Continuous from which one, and only one, must be selected.  The 
     Interrupt Time is the length of time each frequency being output is
     turned on and the equal time that it is turned off repeatedly during
     its Dwell Time.  It is on without interruption if Continuous is
     selected.  

     When the frequency sub-list and 3 parameters have been selected on
     the Program formatted screen, either hit "R" to return to the
     CREATE FILE MENU or hit "A" to advance to the next Program number
     and its formatted screen.  If more than one value for any parameter 
     is selected, an error message appears and the excess must be 
     de-selected before returning or advancing.  If no values are selected
     for any parameter, the default values are assigned with no error
     message.  The default values are indicated on the formatted screen
     with an "*".    

     If there are no frequencies selected in a Program's sub-list, that
     Program is considered blank.  Starting with Program 1, the PFG-100
     will only recognize Programs until the first blank Program is
     encountered.  It then returns to Program 1.  Any non-blank Programs
     past the first blank Program will not be accessible.
 


                                  (10)





     Since none of the data is saved on the floppy disk until you are
     completely done, you may go back and forth between columns using
     the left and right arrow keys, and up and down any given column
     using the up and down arrow keys, selecting and de-selecting entries
     with the "Enter" key until the formatted screen represents the
     Programs just the way you want them.  You can also re-enter Programs
     to view or make changes as many times as desired.

     When the selections for the Master Frequency list and all of the 
     desired Programs have been completed, return to the CREATE FILE MENU 
     and hit "S" to save the selections in a file.

(S) SAVE FILE

     Select this and the software will formulate all of the selection
     data in temporary memory and combine it into one file.  It will
     summarize and display the total number of sub-list frequencies
     and the number of active Programs as shown in the following example:
       "THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUB-LIST FREQUENCIES (LIMIT=118) ARE 73"
       "ACTIVE PROGRAMS ARE P1 TO P4 BECAUSE P5 IS EMPTY"
     The program will then ask 
       "NAME OF FILE TO SAVE DATA UNDER (CR TO CANCEL) ? ".
     Type in the name (up to 8 letters or numbers beginning with a letter)
     that you wish to save it under.  

     If that name does not already exist, a new file is created with that
     name and the software returns to the MAIN MENU.
     
     If that name already exists as a file on the floppy disk, you will be 
     cautioned with the statement:

       "FILENAME ALREADY EXISTS. FILE DATA WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW DATA.
        PROCEED (Y/N) ? "

       If you answer "Y", the old file data will be lost and cannot be
                          retrieved. It will be replaced by the new data.
       If you answer "N", the software will return to the question "NAME OF
                          FILE TO SAVE DATA UNDER (CR TO CANCEL) ? " and 
                          give you a chance to select another name that has 
                          not been used.
     
     To abort from saving the file, respond with "Enter" (CR) without a
     name.  The software returns to the CREATE FILE MENU.     

     After saving the created file, the software returns to the main
     menu selection but does not send the created file to the PFG-100
     until commanded to send it from the MAIN MENU selection "S" SEND FILE.


7.0 EDIT FILE MENU
     
     When "E" is selected from the MAIN MENU, a new screen appears with
     the question "NAME OF FILE TO EDIT (CR TO CANCEL) ? > ".  Enter 
     the name of the file to edit (see 5.0 MAIN MENU part (E) EDIT FILE).  
     The file data is obtained from the floppy disk and put into temporary
     memory.  The EDIT FILE MENU is displayed from which formatted screens 
     are selected to enter the main frequency list or Programs 1-9.  When 
     all of the data has been entered for the complete file, it may be 
     saved by hitting "S" while in the EDIT FILE MENU.
                                  (11)






                      EDIT FILE MENU

                      (R) RETURN TO MAIN MENU

                      SELECTION ? > _



(M) EDIT MASTER FREQUENCY LIST

     This selection is very similar to the CREATE MASTER FREQUENCY 
     selection except instead of displaying an initial blank list it 
     displays the existing Master Frequency list of the file being edited.
     Do not make changes to the Master Frequency list if the goal is to
     make some changes to the file's Programs only. Or do make changes if 
     the goal is to use the Master Frequency list as a starting point for
     a new list and then adding and/or removing some frequencies.  As 
     mentioned earlier in the NOTE OF CAUTION (under 6.0), making changes 
     to the Master Frequency list may shift the position of the 
     frequencies and cause a different set of sub-list frequencies to be 
     selected in the Programs.

     Review CREATE MASTER FREQUENCY LIST because the same instructions
     apply to EDIT MASTER FREQUENCY LIST.  

(1) EDIT PROGRAM P1  (typical of all 9)

     This selection causes the Program number formatted screen to appear 
     with the named file's Master Frequency list containing the selection 
     of frequencies forming the sub-list, and 3 columns containing the 
     named file's selections of parameter values for the Mode, the Dwell 
     Time and the Interrupt Time.  

     Review CREATE PROGRAM P1 because the same instructions apply to
     EDIT PROGRAM P1.

(S) SAVE FILE
    
     The comments for SAVE FILE are the same as under CREATE FILE MENU.






                                  (12)








USEFUL SYSTEM COMMANDS
----------------------

When the software is exited to the DOS computer system, the files may be 
listed, erased, copied and renamed with certain standard system commands.
The file names used with the software have extensions added to them for
residing in the system and on disk.  The extension to the name is .P10
This extension must be tacked onto the name for the system commands to
operate, but must be omitted when used with the programming software.

LIST FILES
----------
All of the files saved on disk and available to program the PFG-100 can
be listed by typing "DIR *.P10" at the system prompt. For example,
      A:> DIR *.P10
"*" is a wildcard designator so all file names with the .P10 extension 
will be listed.

ERASE FILES
-----------
Any file saved on disk and available to program the PFG-100 can be erased
by typing "ERASE NAME.P10" where NAME is replaced with the name of the
file to be erased. For example, to erase a file named "SAM1"
     A:> ERASE SAM1.P10

COPY FILES
----------
A file saved on disk and available to program the PFG-100 can be copied
to a different file name and the files under both names will be identical.
For example,
     A:> COPY SAM1.P10 SAM2.P10
A copy of SAM1 will be made and named SAM2.  Both will be the same.

RENAME FILES
------------
A file saved on disk and available to program the PFG-100 can be renamed
to a new file name.  The old file name will no longer exist.
     A:> RENAME SAM1.P10 SAM9.P10
SAM9.P10 replaces the name SAM1.P10 which disappears.
