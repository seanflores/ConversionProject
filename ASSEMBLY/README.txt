  Attached is the assembly language source code for the PFG100 microcomputer.
  The main module SAMC4.SAM calls all of the other modules.
  You are missing a reference file RG51FB.PDF which is specific to the microcomputer I was using but is not necessary for 
  understanding the code.  It is only necessary to compile the code.
  If you want it and the compiler software let me know.
  Striptmp.ww was written to remove spaces at the end of each module which were added by DOS to fill the last 256 bytes of the code.
  SAMC4.HEX is the compiled code used for programming the microcomputer.
